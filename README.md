# Chaos Engineering for AI Agents

A comprehensive framework for testing AI agent resilience under network failures and service disruptions. This educational project demonstrates chaos engineering principles by injecting network toxics between LLM-based agents and their backend tools.

## üéØ Purpose

This framework helps you understand:
- How AI agents behave under network failures
- Chaos engineering principles and implementation
- Distributed system resilience patterns
- LLM agent tool interaction patterns
- Network failure simulation and testing

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system consists of four main components:

### 1. AI Agent (`agent/`)
- **LangChain-based agent** using Groq's Llama model
- **10 integrated tools**: search, weather, movies, calendar, calculator, messaging, translation
- **Smart retry logic** with configurable limits and fallback mechanisms
- **Comprehensive logging** and metrics collection
- **Configurable failure probabilities** for controlled chaos injection

### 2. Proxy Manager (`Toxiproxy/`)
- **Orchestrates chaos injection** based on agent activity and probability settings
- **Creates network proxies** for each backend service
- **Injects timeout toxics** (upstream/downstream) randomly
- **SQLite-based state management** for coordination between services
- **Health monitoring** and service lifecycle management

### 3. Backend Services (`flask_tools/`)
- **7 Flask microservices** providing realistic tool implementations:
  - Search (SERP API mock)
  - Weather (OpenWeather API mock)
  - Movies (TMDB API mock)
  - Calendar (Event management)
  - Calculator (Mathematical operations)
  - Messaging (Send/receive messages)
  - Translator (Multi-language translation using [deep-translator](https://pypi.org/project/deep-translator/))
- **Request deduplication** and health checks
- **Realistic API responses** for testing

### 4. Infrastructure
- **Docker Compose orchestration** with service dependencies
- **Toxiproxy integration** for network chaos injection
- **Shared state management** via SQLite databases
- **Volume mounting** for logs and persistent state

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Working Docker setup that can run multi-container applications
  - On Linux: Native Docker installation
  - On Windows/Mac: Docker Desktop or WSL2 with Docker
- **Groq API Key**: Sign up at [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/) for free API access
- **A movies.json**:a json array at (`flask_tools/tmdb/`) containing random movie information with atleast two fields,"name" and "original_name" for accurate api simulation,
                    handles errors in its absense
  
## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd chaos-engineering-ai-agents
```

### 2. Create Required Directories and Files

```bash
# Create required directories
mkdir -p state logs

# Create empty database files
touch agent/network.db
touch state/state.db

# Create empty log files (optional - will be created automatically)
touch logs/info.log
touch logs/agent.log
```

### 3. Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
TOXIC_PROB=0.1
ERROR_PROB=0.1
TOOL_LIMIT=1
PROMPT_LIMIT=1
```
**Note**:If the env vars arent passed explicitly and/or undefined in the .env aswell,hardcoded values given above are then used

**Configuration Variables:**
- `GROQ_API_KEY`: Your Groq API key (required)
- `TOXIC_PROB`: Probability of injecting network toxics (0.0-1.0)
- `ERROR_PROB`: Probability of simulated tool errors (0.0-1.0)
- `TOOL_LIMIT`: Maximum retry attempts per tool call
- `PROMPT_LIMIT`: Maximum retry attempts per prompt

### 4. Create Your Prompts File

Create `agent/prompts.json` with your test prompts:

```json
[
  {
    "prompt": "What's the weather like in New York today?"
  },
  {
    "prompt": "Search for information about chaos engineering"
  },
  {
    "prompt": "Calculate the result of 15 * 23 + 47"
  },
  {
    "prompt": "Add an event to my calendar for tomorrow at 2 PM titled 'Team Meeting'"
  },
  {
    "prompt": "Translate 'Hello, how are you?' to Spanish"
  }
]
```

### 5. Run the System

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Monitor logs
docker-compose logs -f agent

# Stop the system
docker-compose down
```

Alternatively, you can override environment variables directly:

```bash
docker-compose up -d \
  -e TOXIC_PROB=0.2 \
  -e ERROR_PROB=0.15 \
  -e TOOL_LIMIT=2 \
  -e PROMPT_LIMIT=3
```

## üìä Monitoring and Analysis

### Log Files

The system generates detailed logs in the `logs/` directory:

- **`info.log`**: System events, network latency, tool failures, configuration details
- **`agent.log`**: Agent responses, prompt processing, error details, timing metrics

### Sample Metrics Visualization

A reference `charts.py` is provided to visualize the collected metrics:

```bash
# Install visualization dependencies
pip install matplotlib pandas seaborn

# Generate charts from logs
python charts.py
```

This creates various charts including:
- Throughput over time
- Success rate analysis
- Network latency patterns
- Error distribution
- Response time trends

**Note**: The provided `charts.py` is a reference implementation. You can customize it or create your own visualization tools based on the rich metrics collected.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Agent Configuration (`agent/config.json`)

```json
{
  "proxy": {
    "search": "6000",
    "weather": "6001", 
    "movie": "6002",
    "calendar": "6003",
    "translator": "6006",
    "calculator": "6004",
    "message": "6005"
  },
  "services": {
    "search": "search_tool:5000",
    "weather": "weather_tool:5001",
    "movie": "movie_tool:5002", 
    "calendar": "calendar_tool:5003",
    "calculator": "calculator_tool:5004",
    "message": "message_tool:5005",
    "translator": "translator_tool:5006",
    "proxy_mgr": "proxy_mgr:8000"
  },
  "intervals": {
    "proxy_check_interval": 3,
    "proxy_wait": 30,
    "proxy_mgr_wait": 40,
    "proxy_timeout": 5,
    "fallback_timeout": 10
  },
  "files": {
    "prompts": "prompts.json"
  }
}
```

### Proxy Configuration (`Toxiproxy/constants/constant.go`)

**Important**: Keep this configuration synchronized with your `agent/config.json`:

```go
var ProxyConfig = []struct {
    Name     string
    Listen   string
    Upstream string
}{
    {"search_proxy", "0.0.0.0:6000", "search_tool:5000"},
    {"weather_proxy", "0.0.0.0:6001", "weather_tool:5001"},
    // ... other services
}
```

### Fallback Configuration (`agent/defaults.py`)

Configure fallback values in case `config.json` is missing or incomplete. **Ensure this matches your intended configuration exactly** as it's the final fallback layer.

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Tools

1. **Create a new Flask service** in `flask_tools/your_tool/`
2. **Add service to `docker-compose.yaml`** with health checks
3. **Update `agent/config.json` and `agent/defaults.py`** with new proxy and service entries
4. **Update `Toxiproxy/constants/constant.go`** with new proxy configuration
5. **Add tool implementation** in `agent/toolbuilder.py`
6. **Update the items list** in `agent/main.py` if needed

### Modifying Chaos Patterns

Edit the toxic injection logic in `Toxiproxy/main.go`:
- Change toxic types (timeout, latency, bandwidth, etc.)
- Modify injection probabilities
- Add custom failure patterns
- Implement different chaos strategies

### Custom Metrics and Logging

The framework logs extensive metrics. You can:
- Parse logs for custom analysis
- Add new metrics in the agent code
- Create custom dashboards
- Implement real-time monitoring

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **info.log says no api key was set or shows issue with prompts.json**
   - Check if `GROQ_API_KEY` is set correctly
   - Verify `prompts.json` exists and is valid JSON array

2. **Services won't start**
   - Ensure Docker daemon is running
   - Check port conflicts (ports 5000-5006, 6000-6006, 8000)
   - Verify required directories exist

3. **Database errors**
   - Ensure `state/state.db` and `agent/network.db` exist
   - Check volume mount permissions

4. **Configuration mismatches**
   - Verify `config.json` and `constants.go` are synchronized
   - Check `defaults.py` fallback values

### Debugging

```bash
# Check service status
docker-compose ps

# View specific service logs
docker-compose logs proxy_mgr
docker-compose logs agent

# Enter a running container
docker-compose exec agent bash

# Check database state
sqlite3 state/state.db "SELECT * FROM control;"
```
